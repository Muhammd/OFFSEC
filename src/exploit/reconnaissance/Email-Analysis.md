## OSINT

- **[InQuest Labs](https://labs.inquest.net/)**

- **[Message Header Analyzer](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/)**

    Analyses message header of email. It helps to check the phishing emails.

- **[PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/)**

    Combines threat intelligence, OSINT, email metadata and battle tested auto-analysis pathways into one powerful phishing response platform.

- **[Simple Email Reputation](https://emailrep.io/)**

    Paste the sender’s email address to check if the address is suspicious.

- **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)**

## Email Source Analysis

We can see the email source in each provider or execute the following commands.

```sh
open example.xml
strings example.eml
```

Check the following headers to distinguish whether it is spoofed.

### Authentication-Results

Each value in **`dkim`, `spf`, `dmarc`** should be **`pass`**. If not, the email may be spoofed.

### Received  
    
It should match the sender’s email address.

### Received-SPF

Its value should be **`pass`**. If its value is **`faile`, `softfail`, `neutral` or `none`**, the email may be spoofed.

### Others

Besides, check if the sender displayed name or address match **`From`, `Reply-To`, `Return-Path`** in headers. However, these header values can be modified by attackers so it could not be relied perfectly.  

<br />

## Be Careful of Fake Reply Message

If the email contains **`RE:`** (Regarding) which means replying your message, we need to check that it’s a really reply message. Attacker may impersonate reply message that victim communicated in the past.

<br /><br />

## Malware Detection in Attached Files

If you got email in which attached **`suspicious`** files, you need to investigate them.

1. **View the Message Source**

2. **Copy the Attached File's Base64**

3. **Change Base64 to SHA256**

    ```sh
    sha256sum attached_file.doc
    # or
    sha256sum <base64-string>
    ```

    Or there are some useful tools:

    - **[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)** is useful to change the cipher.

4. **Investigate the Hash**
