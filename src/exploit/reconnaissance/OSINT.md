## Automation

OSINT is a powerful method for investigating target organizations, websites, etc. However, it's the tedious task to surfin the internet for finding desired information one by one. For that reason, it's also recommended to use automation tools.  

*It might overlap a bit with recon automation tools

- [BBOT](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot)
    
    A powerful subdomain scanner and port mapper.
    
- [Blackbird](https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird)
    
    Searches accounts by username in social networks.
    
- [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/)
    
    A comprehensive tool for information gathering.
    
- [PhoneInfoga](https://github.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga)
