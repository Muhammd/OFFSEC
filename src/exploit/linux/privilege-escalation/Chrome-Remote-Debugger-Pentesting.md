## Investigation

```bash
/usr/bin/google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=12345
```

If the target system is running **Google Chrome Debugger** with specific port, we can port forward and may be able to retrieve sensitive data in browser debugging mode.

<br />

## Exploitation

### 1. Port Forwarding

First off, start port forwarding in local machine.  

```bash
ssh -L 12345:127.0.0.1:12345 remote-user@example.com
```

### 2. Configure Network Targets in Chrome

Assume the chrome debugger is running on port **12345**.  
Open Chrome browser and input the following string in URL bar at the top of the window.

```bash
chrome://inspect/#devices
```

Then click **“Configure…”** at the right of **“Discover network targets”**. The modal window opens.  
In the modal window, enter **“localhost:12345”** then click **“Done”**.  
Now we should see the remote host appears at the bottom of the **“Remote Target”**.  
Click **“inspect”** then new browser open. We can browse the website.
