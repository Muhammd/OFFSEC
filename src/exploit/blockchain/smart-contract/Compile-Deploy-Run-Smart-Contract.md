## Ethereum Remix Extension in VS Code

[Ethereum Remix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RemixProject.ethereum-remix) extension is **the VS Code plugin** that can perform a variety of tasks such as verifying contracts.

### 1. Connect

In the left pane, click Explorer tab and open the **"REMIX"** field at the bottom. Then choose **"Run & Deploy"** and select **"Activate"**. The **"Run & Deploy"** window opens.  
In Connection field, enter the address and click Connect.

### 2. Compile

Next, select the file you want to compile, and click Compile.

### 3. Deploy

After compiling, select the contract you want to deploy, then click Deploy.

### 4. Run

If deploying the contract successfully, we can see functions of the contract.  
Click **TRANSACT** or **CALL** at the function you want to.  
After that, we can see the output at the bottom.
