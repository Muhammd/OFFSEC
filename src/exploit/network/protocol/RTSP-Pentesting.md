## Watch RTSP Stream using VLC Media Player

Reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksUylvdJQDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksUylvdJQDQ)  

We might be able to watch **RTSP stream** using a media player such as **VLC**. Here is the example for VLC.  
First off, if we donâ€™t have the VLC Media Player, we need to install it by the following command.

```bash
sudp apt install vlc
```

Then open **VLC**, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Open Network Stream...** in **Media** menu.
2. In another dialog, enter the network URL like **`rtsp://10.0.0.2:554`**. Replace **`10.0.0.2`** with target ip address.
3. Enter username and password in login screen.

Now we might be able to watch RTSP stream.
