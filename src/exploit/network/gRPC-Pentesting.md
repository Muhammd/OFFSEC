## Connect with [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui)

**`grpcui`** is an interactive web UI for **gRPC**.  
If you donâ€™t have `grpcui`, you need to install it.

```bash
go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui/cmd/grpcui@latest
```

Then we can interact with gRPC.

```bash
grpcui -plaintext example.com:9019
```
