## Proxychains

Proxychains forces any TCP connection made by any given application to follow 
through proxy like TOR or any other SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP(S) proxy.

- **configuration**

    ```sh
    vim /etc/proxychains.conf

    # -----------------------------------------------------

    # If performing nmap for port scan through proxychains, comment out the following. Otherwise it will hang and crash.
    proxy_dns
    ```

    If you lost a configuration file, download from the repository.

    ```sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haad/proxychains/master/src/proxychains.conf -O /etc/proxychains.conf
    ```

Now start the Tor service and run the following command to open the Firefox via proxychains.

```sh
proxychains firefox
```
