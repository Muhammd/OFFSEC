## Local Port Forwarding

We can forward a port on the local machine to a port on the remote machine by adding the flag **"-L"** with SSH.  
Also, it is required the remote SSH username/password.

```sh
ssh -L [<local-ip>:]<local-port>.<destination-ip>:<destination-port> remote-user@<remote-ip>

# -f: Background
# -N Do not execute remote commands
ssh -L [<local-ip>:]<local-port>:<destination-ip>:<destination-port> remote-user@<remote-ip> -fN
```

### Examples

Below are some examples.

```sh
# We can access the internal webserver in the remote machin via http://127.0.0.1/
sudo ssh -L 80:127.0.0.1:80 john@example.com
sudo ssh -L localhost:80:127.0.0.1:80 john@example.com

# We can connect the database on local port 3306
ssh -L 3306:db.example.com:3306 john@example.com
ssh -L localhost:3306:db.example.com:3306 john@example.com
# Another port
ssh -L 3336:db.example.com:3306 john@example.com

# Multiple ports
ssh -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8001 -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 john@example.com
```

### Stop Local Port Forwarding

To stop the local port forwarding if it is running background, find the process ID and specify it to **`kill`** command.

```sh
ps aux | grep ssh
kill <PID>
```

<br />

## Remote Port Forwarding

We can forward a port on the remote machine to a port on the local machine by adding the flag **"-R"** with SSH.  

```sh
ssh -R [<remote-ip>:]<remote-port>:<destination-ip>:<destination-port> remote-user@<remote-ip>
```

### Examples

Below are some examples.

```sh
# A remote user can view our local website running on port 3000 by accessing on the port 8080 from the remote machine.
ssh -R 8080:127.0.0.1:3000 john@example.com
ssh -R example.com:8080:127.0.0.1:3000 john@example.com
```

<br />

## Dynamic Port Forwarding

If we cannot determine the remote ports opened internally, we can find them using dynamic port forwarding.  
First off,  execute the dynamic port forwarding using ssh.

```sh
ssh -D 1337 remote-user@<remote-ip>
```

And update the configuration for Proxychains.  
In **“/etc/proxychains.conf”**, comment out **“socks4 127.0.0.1 9050"** and add **“socks5 127.0.0.1 1337”** on the bottom of the file.  

```bash
# socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 127.0.0.1 1337
```

After that, try port scanning to find open ports of the remote machine over 127.0.0.1.

```sh
proxychains nmap 127.0.0.1
```

When we found the open ports, we can execute the Local Port Forwarding using the ports we found.  
*By the way, we can close the previous dynamic port forwarding if not necessary.

```bash
ssh -L <local-port>:127.0.0.1:<port-we-found> remote-user@<remote-ip>

# e.g.
# If we want to open port 80 in local, we need to run as root privilege.
sudo ssh -L 80:127.0.0.1:80 john@example.com
ssh -L 3306:127.0.0.1:3306 john@example.com
```

For instance, assume that the remote machine opens port 80 internally.  
Now access http://127.0.0.1/. We can access the remote webserver.

## Reverse Connection

Reverse connections are often used in situations where the server needs to be accessible from the client's network, but the server's network is restricted. By initiating a reverse connection, the client can establish a connection to the server without the need for the server to be accessible on the public internet.

### 1. Generate SSH Keys in Remote Machine

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

Then save them (public key and private key) to arbitrary folder.

```sh
mkdir /home/remote-user/reverse-keys
mv id_rsa /home/remote-user/reverse-keys
mv id_rsa.pub /home/remote-user/reverse-keys
```

Copy the content of public key (id_rsa.pug).

### 2. Add Content of Public Key to authorized_key in Your Local Machine

```sh
echo 'content of publick key' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_key
```

To clarify that the key only for reverse connection, add the following line to this content in authorized_key.

```sh
# ~/.ssh/authorized_key
command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty id-rsa
AAAAAB3NzaC........
```

Check if SSH server is running.  
If the server is not running, start SSH server.

```sh
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

### 3. Run Reverse Proxy in Remote Machine

Reverse port forwarding using the private key (id_rsa)

```sh
ssh -R <local-port>:<remote-ip>:<remote-port> local-user@<local-ip> -i id_rsa -fN
```

### 4. Confirmation in Your Local Machine

You can access to **\<remote-ip>:\<remote-port>**

### 5. Close Connection in Remote Machine

After that, stop reverse connection.

```sh
ps aux | grep ssh
sudo kill <PID>
```
