## Upgrade

After connecting to the target shell with reverse shell, it's recommended to make the shell to be more elegant.

```sh
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# or
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# or
python2 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# or
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null
```

The commands below make our shell even more perfect.

```sh
Ctrl+z
stty raw -echo;fg
Enter x2
export TERM=xterm
```
