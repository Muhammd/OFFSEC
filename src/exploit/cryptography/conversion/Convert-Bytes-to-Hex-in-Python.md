## Conversion

Using **`hex`** method in Python, we can easily convert bytes to hex.

```python
b'Hello World'.hex()
# 48656c6c6f20576f726c64

b'abcdef'.hex()
# 616263646566

b'\xe3\x81\xad\xe3\x81\x93'.hex()
# e381ade38193
```

By the way, for converting from string to bytes before converting bytes to hex, use **`encode`** method as below.

```python
'Hello World'.encode().hex()
# 48656c6c6f20576f726c64
```
