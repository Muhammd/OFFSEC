## Conversion

Using **`decode`** method in Python, we can easily convert **bytes** to **string**.  
There are three types of **`decode`** methods as below.  

All of the results say **"Hello"**.

```python
b'Hello'.decode('utf-8')

bytes.decode(b'Hello', 'utf-8')

codecs.decode(b'Hello', 'utf-8')
```
