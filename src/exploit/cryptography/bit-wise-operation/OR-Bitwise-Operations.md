## Basic

Assume we want to **OR** operation **0100** and **1001**.

```python
0100
# OR
1001

# Result: 1101
```

We can do that using **`|`** operator in Python.

```python
0b0100 | 0b1001
# 13 ('1101' in binary)

4 | 9
# 13 ('1101' in binary)

# Binary representation
bin(0b0100 | 0b1001)
# 0b1101
```
