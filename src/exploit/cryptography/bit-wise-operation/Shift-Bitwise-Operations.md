## Basic

### Left Bit Shift

Assume we want to left bit shift the binary **`0100`** as below.

```txt
0100 -> 1000
```

We can achieve this using the **`<<`** operator in Python.

```python
0b100 << 1
# 8 ('1000' in binary)

4 << 1
# 8 ('1000' in binary)

# Output as the binary representation
bin(8 << 1)
# 0b1000
```

### Right Bit Shift

Assume we want to right bit shift the binary **`0100`** as below.

```txt
0100 -> 0010
```

We can achieve this using the **`>>`** operator in Python.

```python
0b100 >> 1
# 2 ('10' in binary)

4 >> 1
# 2 ('10' in binary)

bin(4 >> 1)
# 0b10
```
