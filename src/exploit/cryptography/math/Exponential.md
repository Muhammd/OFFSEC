## Basic

We can calculate the exponentiation using **'\*\*'** operator in Python.

```python
2 ** 4
# 16

6 ** 8
# 1679616
```

<br />

## Using Pow Method in Python

The **`pow`** method can be used for the exponentiation.

```python
pow(2, 4)
# 2 ** 4 = 16
```

### Modular Exponentiation

In addition, we can find the remainder of dividing a rased value by a specific number.  
This may be sometimes used to find the secret key in **key derivation functions**, etc.

```python
pow(2, 4, 6)
# 2 ** 4 % 6 = 4
```

<br />

## Inverse

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse

inverse(3, 10) # 7
pow(3, -1, 10) # 7
```
