## Enumerate Active Directory

### 1. Collect Information with Sharphound

In target machine, download SharpHound and run.

```powershell
# Enumerate the AD information that can be visualized in Bloodhound
Sharphound.exe --CollectionMethods All --Domain dc.example.com --ExcludeDCs 
```

Then the zip file will be generated. This file can be displayed in Bloodhound.  
To transfer the zip file to local machine, run the following command in local machine.

```sh
scp <ad_username>@example.com:C:/Path/To/<sharphound_result>.zip .
```

### 2. Start Bloodhound
    
In local machine, start neo4j console.

```sh
sudo neo4j console
```

After that, in another terminal, start Bloodhound. 

```sh
bloodhound --no-sandbox
```

This shows the authentication GUI. The default credential is:

```txt
neo4j:neo4j
```

However, we may need to change the neo4j password via http://localhost:7474/.
    
### 3. Visualize a ZIP File

In Bloodhound, drag and drop the zip file which we transferd in the previous section.  
Json files will be imported.

### 4. Attack Paths

After importing, we can view the several attack paths. Click the three stripe icon on the top-left of the window.
