## Escape WSL to Windows Host Machine

If weâ€™are currently on WSL machine, we can access to the host Windows machine as below.

```bash
cd /mnt/c/
```

If **`/mnt/c/`** is empty, we need to mount the folder by running the following command.

```bash
cd /

# -t: Limit the set of filesystem types
# drvfs: A plugin for WSL
# C: : Specify the Windows root
mount -t drvfs C: /mnt/c
```
