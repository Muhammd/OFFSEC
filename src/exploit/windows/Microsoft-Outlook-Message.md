## Extract Attached Files

If the message is attached some file e.g. **`.zip`**, we can extract the file.

### 1. In CyberChef, paste the text contains Base64 encoded.

For example,

```txt
Content-ID: 
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name=example.zip
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=example.zip
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

### 2. Attach “Base64” and “Extract Files” operations.

After baking, we should get the attached file and download it.
