title: HTTP Rate Limit Bypass
description: The 429 “Too Many Requests” response in HTTP header occurs when the client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting). That is because the server limits the number of requests. However, we may be able to bypass this restriction.

## Bypass

We may be able to bypass the rate limiting by adding one of the following headers and change the IP per request.  
Sometimes, we need to add multiple headers.

```bash
X-Forwarded: <IP>
X-Forwarded-For: <IP>
X-Forwarded-Host: <IP>
X-Client-IP: <IP>
X-Remote-IP: <IP>
X-Remote-Addr: <IP>
X-Host: <IP>
X-Originating-IP: <IP>
```
