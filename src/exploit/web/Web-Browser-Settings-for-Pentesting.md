## Bypass Port Protection

Many browsers don't accept uncommon ports for HTTP (HTTPS).    
For example, when we attempt to access [http://example.com:22](http://example.com:22/), browsers present that it cannot be accessed.

To release such a restricted thing, we can edit the setting in browsers.

### Firefox

1. Enter **"about:config"** in search bar.
2. Input **"network.security.ports.banned.override"** in the form.
3. Add the desired port (e.g. “22”) to **string**.
