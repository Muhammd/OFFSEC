## Investigation

We can decompile **`.dll`** files using **[ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)** in Windows. If you like to use ILSpy in Linux, use **[AvaloniaILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvaloniaILSpy)**.

```csharp
json = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Example>(json);
```

If the application uses **“JsonConvert.DeserializeObject”** function, we can abuse JSON object and execute arbitrary code or read local files.

<br />

## Exploitation

We can give the Json value to the “JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json)” with a reserved key (**`$type`**).  
The format is as follow. The value of **`$type`** is a string that contains the assembly-qualified name of the .NET type to be deserialized. 

```json
{
	"$type": "<namespace>.<class>, <assembly>",
	"<method_name>": "<attribute>"
}
```

### LFI

If the application has the method that reads file, we can use this method and read desired files by abusing JSON oject to deserialize. For example, the application has **"ReadFile"** method in the **"File"** class so we can use it to read local files.

```json
{
	"$type": "Example.File, example",
	"ReadFile": "../../../../etc/passwd"
}
```

## Deserialization Payload Generator

For .NET, we can use [Ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net) but Windows machine required.
