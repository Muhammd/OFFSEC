## Investigation

For example, assume that website modifies user input then validation check when logged in as the following JavaScript (e.g. `validation.js`). 

```jsx
// validation.js
function validate() {
	let username = document.getElementById("username").value;
	let password = document.getElementById("password").value;

	// Change the username input if it contains "admin" to confuse attackers.
	username = username.replace(/admin/g, "noob");

	// If the input value of the username/password are both "admin", we can bypass this validation.
	if (username === "admin" && password === "admin") {
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```

By the way, this example may not exist in real world because itâ€™s too simple.

## Exploitation

1. In web browser, open **Developer tools**.
2. Go to **Sources** tab and select target JavaScript file which checks user input.
3. Add a breakpoint at the line where the validation is executed e.g. at the line **`if (username === "admin"...`** in the above **`validation.js`** example.
4. Back to the web login page, and input username/password in login form. Then submit.
5. Browser stops at the breakpoint we've added.
6. Go to **Console** tab in developer tool.
7. Assign the desired value to the target variable e.g. `username = "admin"`(reassign "admin" to undo what was modified by JavaScript).
