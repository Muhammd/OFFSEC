## Download Request File in Burp Suite

1. Right click on the request field in **Burp Suite**.
2. Click **"Save item"** or **"Copy to file"** to download the request state.
3. Save as **"request.txt"** (this is arbitrary name).

<br />

## Using Request File in SQLmap

After downloading the request file in Burp Suite as the previous section, we can use when running **SQLmap**.

```sh
sqlmap -r request.txt
```

By the way, we can see what **SQLmap** send payloads to websites by adding the **`--proxy`** flag.

```sh
# 8080 is the default port of Burp Suite
sqlmap -r request.txt --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
